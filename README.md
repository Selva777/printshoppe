# Print Shoppe - a 3D print queue for hackathons

### TODO
1. Form validation
2. Split out mailgun config
3. Integrate levelDBour
4. Small admin for levelDB
5. Rename each status page, perhaps integrate this with levelDB
6. Create vanilla theme, current theme as optional in config
7. Sky castle:
 * create stl plating software (look for existing first, ask github)
 * connect up with OctoPrint (use built in API to import an stl plate file)
8. Create setup sh script/guide to get all of the parts up and running, if necessary.

### Draft of setup instructions
1. Install OctoPi on your Raspberry Pi
2. Clone/npm install printshoppe
3. cd printshoppe
4. Run setup.sh
5. Send yourself a test print
